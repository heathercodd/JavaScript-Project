"# JavaScript-Project" 

Project Overview:
The project was to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a HR application containing employee information (NI number, full name, phone number, address, department), to be displayed on screen. 
Application users will be able to add an employee, edit an employee, delete an employee, and filter the list of employees by department.

Why are we doing this?
This project was undertaken at the end of the QA Academy, to demonstrate an understanding of the concepts learned.

How I expected the challenge to go:
I expected this challenge to go well, as I enjoyed learning the content and found some of the concepts (mostly in HTML and CSS) to be fairly intuatitive.

What went well?
I think that I was quite good at testing the application and figuring out where there were any issues to be resolved, for example after adding a new functionality which sometimes interacted in unexpected ways. I am very happy with the way my application looks and functions.

What didn't go as planned?
I struggled slightly at the start of the project with writing the JavaScript to get my initial function working. However, after some revision and researching, I managed to solve the problem, and developing the other functions went very smoothly after this inital hurdle. 

Possible improvements for future:
An improvememnt for the future might be for me to improve my JavaScript code to be tidier/non-repeating, as well as functional.
